Powered by fusion, internal combustion, electricity, hydrogen, wind, people, paracausal engines, or something even more unusual, vehicles can carry people, mount weapons, be girded in armor, or otherwise accomplish quickly the simple tasks for which they were designed: moving people and things quickly and in good condition from point A to point B.<br>This template can be applied to any Mech NPC.
